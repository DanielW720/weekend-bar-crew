# Weekend Bar Crew

This repository contains the Next.js project for [weekendbarcrew.com](https://weekendbarcrew.com).

The [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/weekend-bar-crew/overview) is version controlled in the [WBC Revision project](https://github.com/DanielW720/wbc-revision). To run the local emulators, go to the root directory of that project and follow the instructions. Then in this project, run `FIREBASE_EMULATORS=true npm run dev` to use the local Firestore emulator etc. Note that there is no Algolia search emulator.
